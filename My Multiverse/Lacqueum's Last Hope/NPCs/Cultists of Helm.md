# Cultists of Helm


## Description
The cultists of Helm are...well cultists of Helm. This is a strange god to be a cultist for, as Helm is often worshiped by good. Technically however, Helm is a Neutral god, so he does pay favors to all who follow in his ways, even those often considered evil. These cultists are such an example, they believe in ultimate protection, and therefor are willing to sacrifice everything if it means keeping their most sacred artifact, the Orb of Loc L'Armur, safe.


## Bagdreth, the Orb Demon
- Bagdreth is a [draegloth](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#draegloth_mpmm) that would prefer not to have to fight or interact with the party.
    - He was assigned to protect the orb for all eternity and has been doing so for the past ~200 years.
        - He would like nothing more than to be free of his prison.
            - He may make a deal with the party to never speak of him and he will leave them in peace, so long as they defeat the big boss inside. Should they fail, then he will destroy them along-side the boss to keep the illusion of trust up.


## Chiefiel, the Master of Protection
- Chiefiel is a master of all protection. He is capable of harnessing the power of the Orb of Loc L'Armur without needing to equip it! This power makes Chiefiel a fearsome adversary, one worth taking precaution of!
- The stat block can be found [here](NPCs/Statblocks/Chiefiel, Master of Protection.png).
- There will be 4 orb pillars to destroy and it will take away Chiefiel's power.
    - Each pillar is made of stone and has 50 HP.
