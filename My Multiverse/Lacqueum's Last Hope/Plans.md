# Plans


## Beginning
- Reread the primer with music.
    - This should get everyone in the mood.
- Do basic character introductions.
    - This will let players know everyone else's characters.
    - In universe, all these characters already know each other.
        - At least in some capacity...
- Set the [scene](/Settings/Base%20Camp.md).


## Shenanigans at Base Camp
- Party gathers extra supplies.
    - A magical item of rarity Uncommon or less.
    - Anything in one of the following packs:
        - [Burglar's pack](https://5e.tools/items.html#burglar's%20pack_phb)
        - [Dungeoneer's pack](https://5e.tools/items.html#dungeoneer's%20pack_phb)
        - [Explorer's pack](https://5e.tools/items.html#explorer's%20pack_phb)
- Interactions with some of the [NPCs](/NPCs/Party.md).
    - Can convince any of them to come join the party in their adventure.
    - Can tell them to keep guard of base camp for when they come out.
        - How this goes depends on how many people are left to guard:
            - 0: The camp will be taken over by the FALA.
            - 1-2: The FALA are weakened but still capture base.
                - 1: One left will die.
                - 2: Both injured.
            - 3-4: Camp protected.
                - 3: Injured.
                - 4: All set and protected.


## Travel
- The party heads north towards the cavern entrance.
    - It will take 2 hours to get there.
    - They will hit a "random" encounter along the way.
        - Fubor, the cyclops will be seen gardening some onions in his garden deep in the forest.
            - The party must only succeed a *DC 8* stealth check to avoid detection.
            - If encountered, Fubor will plead for his life, stating "Fubor has gone as far into the Thatchwood as Fubor could! Is there no where left for Fubor to go?"
                - If the party chooses to spare Fubor, he will thank them with a basket of onions.
                - If the party attacks then Fubor will try his best to run as far West as possible.
    - They might see (*DC 17*) a group of Chwinga deep in the forest.
        - The Chwinga will take a liking to the party and bestow a [charm](https://5e.tools/rewards.html#blankhash,flsttype:charm=1).
    - After this encounter, the party will make it to the [Cavern Entrance](/Settings/Cavern%20Entrance.md).


## Cavern Entrance
- The party must create a climbing rope, attach it somewhere, and climb down into the cavern.
    - It is a *DC 14* climb down using athletics.
        - If failed, a party member could use a *DC 16* acrobatics to save the fall.
            - If *that* fails, then it's a 30ft drop down.


## Cavern
- The party is at the main entrance of the cavern.
    - They can follow any path they choose on the [map](Settings/Cavern Map.xcf).
- Make sure to check out some information on the different encounters.
