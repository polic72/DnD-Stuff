# Base Camp

## Description
A scrappy campsite with 8 tents, 2 burning campfires, and some tables and chairs set up. The smell of dirt after rain and smoke fills the air. The cracking of the fires is the only thing that breaks the silence of the morning, for no birds would dare venture this far into the Thatchwood. Despite weeding it 100ft away last night, the thatch has grown halfway to base camp, the fires being the only thing holding it back.
