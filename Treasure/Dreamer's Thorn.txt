Story: There came a wanderer from the trackless wastelands, bearing a spear whose haft was from no tree we had ever seen, and its head was a metal we had seen only in our dreams. He had fashioned it, he said, from the tree that flourishes only in moonlight, and from the iron that unmade the first fey. He made it so that magical guile might not hold dominion over all of humanity. "The pricking of this thorn wakens the deepest sleeper," he said, and he gave it to a girl on the cusp of womanhood, whose hands were quick and whose wit was sharp. "Keep it from its fate as long as you may, for it is forever drawn to the One who must stay in dream's shrouding."
