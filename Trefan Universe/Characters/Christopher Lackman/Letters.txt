Auntie Pissiah:

	Thank you for the compliments on our combat tactics, I was quite surprised myself it worked so well. I was not aware, however, that those annoying dragons were Klauth's children; glad to hear that he didn't care much for them. I'm sure you'll do well with the skeletons of them, we won't be needing them. As for our new friend, his name is Cassius and I'm sure he'll take a liking to you should you meet him in a more kindly way.

	Speaking of your first meeting, I'd like to apologize for our slight mishap in the head; one of our party mates pushed the wrong button a little too early....alcohol can often do that. Thank you for explaining some of the buttons more clearly, we needed it.

Thanks again,
-Christopher Lackman

P.S. I'll make sure that Aurora gets the information.

To Rendaril of Bryn Shander,

	Sorry for getting back late my good man! We've had quite the journey so far on the way to Waterdeep.

	[Here I'll say a couple paragraphs on how things went; I'll especially mention our fights with any giants we've encountered, the Dragons too.]
	
	... It therefore gives me great displeasure to inform you of the passing of our dear friend Sirac. Make sure to send our condolences to his family and loved ones.

	On a lighter note, the gold is on the way! We couldn't get much help from Stan Cody, but we found more than we need from another mighty fellow who goes by the name of Jay Gatsby. The city here is truly something to behold! There are ships that fly in the air, lanterns that light the streets without fire, and every structure in sight is that of a castle! I can highly recommend that you visit this place any time you get the chance!

Stay strong Rendaril and Bryn Shander!
-Christopher Lackman, and the Defenders of Icewind Dale

P.S. We will do our best to find your Aunt as soon as possible.

P.P.S. Tell the Sherriff and The Speaker that we read the letter and acknowledge it.

Karpov and Company,

	I express my deep sorrow for the loss of dear Karkoff and great Boner. I am, however, relieved to hear that everyone else made it out unscathed. We shall hold a burial ceremony for those lost when you arive.

	Speaking of, how about you meet us at Waterdeep? Which may or may not be called New Volk City. There is quite a lot going on in here, and I expect us to stay for a little while; perhaps we can talk business there.

	Sorry to cut the conversation short, but we have quite the fellow to meet at lunch with quite soon.

Hope to hear back from you soon,
-Christopher Lackman
