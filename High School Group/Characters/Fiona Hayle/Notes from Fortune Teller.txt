Fiona:
The one I seek is very far, maybe not even on this world. This place is very dangerous. The pursuit of this person isn't very wise, but that won't stop me.

Tempest:
People are chasing you. You have good luck coming in soon. The people who wronged you will face justice, or you will face judement. A person under a pool of water is waiting for you. You should seek them out sooner rather than later.

Captain Shellbones:
You are looking for someone and being hunted at the same time. You might not know about either of these things. Sense willingness to seek out this goal, but the effort isn't enough. A ship is heading towards you at this very moment. Twisted fate (something terrible) to the person you love.

Dragon Gourmet:
A lack of motivation in life, stemming from immaturity. You will find something soon, something that was already there. You don't know what you have until it's gone.
